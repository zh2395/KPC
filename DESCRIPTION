Description: Implementations of two empirical versions the kernel partial correlation (KPC) coefficient
    and the associated variable selection algorithms. KPC is a measure of the strength of conditional
    association between Y and Z given X, with X, Y, Z being random variables taking values in
    general topological spaces. As the name suggests, KPC is defined in terms of kernels on
    reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Users are also allowed to define arbitrary kernels.
    The population KPC is a deterministic number between 0 and 1; it is 0 if and only if Y is
    conditionally independent of Z given X, and it is 1 if and only if Y is a measurable function
    of Z and X. One empirical KPC estimator is based on geometric graphs, such as K-nearest
    neighbor (K-NN) graphs and minimum spanning trees (MST), and is consistent under very weak
    conditions. The other empirical estimator, defined using conditional mean embeddings (CMEs)
    as used in the RKHS literature, is also consistent under suitable conditions. Using KPC, a
    stepwise forward variable selection algorithm KFOCI (using the graph based estimator of KPC)
    is provided, as well as a similar stepwise forward selection algorithm based on the RKHS based
    estimator. For more details on KPC, its empirical estimators and its application on variable
    selection, see Huang, Z., N. Deb, and B. Sen (2020). “Kernel partial correlation coefficient –
    a measure of conditional dependence" <arXiv:2012.14804>. When X is empty, KPC measures
    the unconditional dependence between Y and Z, which has been described in Deb, N., P. Ghosal,
    and B. Sen (2020), “Measuring association on topological spaces using kernels and geometric
    graphs” <arXiv:2010.01768>, and it is implemented in the functions KMAc() and Klin() in this
    package. The latter can be computed in near linear time.
